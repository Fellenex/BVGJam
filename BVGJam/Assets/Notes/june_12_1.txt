Instead of having a DialogPopup Scene, the old project has:

AttractionEntryHolder.prefab
	contains AttractionEntryGraphics.cs (contains references to visual elements within to edit)
		all of these are children elements so they come for free every instantiation


GameManager holds a reference to the AttractionEntryHolder prefab
	this can be instantiated whenever






Currently (10:25pm)

	DialogData.cs
		loads a scene with one or more parameters
		get parameter value
		set parameter value

	DialogGraphics.cs
		sets text to blank depending on starting speaker

	DialogManager.cs
		tells graphics what to do based on the values from DialogData
