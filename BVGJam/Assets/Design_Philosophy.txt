If we let players exit out of conversations, then either:
    we have to do a bunch of extra work to remember which
    state and/or statement we left off in, so that they
    can resume from the same place, or we end up with the
    potential for repeated conversations.

I think exiting out of a conversation shouldn't be an option
    for players. Just a debug thing.

Options for directing conversations:
    Each conversation has a specified follower
        Pro: simpler JSON
        Con: Kinda railroady as a structure.
            Also eliminates the some precedence flows

    Each conversation has a list of specified followers
        Pro: Localizes precedence errors
            Only have to be careful about metacondition correctness in a small range
        Con: Clunkier JSON - again :'(
            A more restrictive structure - conversations need to know about each other
        
    Treat every conversation as a possible follower
        (i went with this option as the solution)
        Pro: Simplest JSON - no need for attribute changes
        Con: Every conversation needs to have good metaconditions.
            Could result in a lot of data edits for small conversation edits


Adding a new NPC to the game:
    Add an NPC prefab to the scene
    Create a prefab variant with your specific NPC name (if you want).
    Update the sprite from default image
    Add a Dialog JSON to the NPC_Attributes component
    Add the gameobject to DialogManager's Dialog Manager component



Longer-Term Development
    Lighting
    Audio Slider
    Main Screen Menu
    Credits Menu
    "Typing" text for DialogGraphics

    Use Unity Editor layer collision settings instead of IgnorePlayerCollide.cs
    Make the camera snapping not so rigid (a little wiggle room in the middle w the fancy camera)
