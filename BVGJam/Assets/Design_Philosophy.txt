If we let players exit out of conversations, then either:
    we have to do a bunch of extra work to remember which
    state and/or statement we left off in, so that they
    can resume from the same place, or we end up with the
    potential for repeated conversations.

I think exiting out of a conversation shouldn't be an option
for players. Just a debug thing.

Options for directing conversations:

    Each conversation has a specified follower
        Pro: simpler JSON
        Con: Kinda railroady as a structure.
            Also eliminates the some precedence flows

    Each conversation has a list of specified followers
        Pro: Localizes precedence errors
            Only have to be careful about metacondition correctness in a small range
        Con: Clunkier JSON - again :'(
            A more restrictive structure - conversations need to know about each other
        
    Treat every conversation as a possible follower
        Pro: Simplest JSON - no need for attribute changes
        Con: Every conversation needs to have good metaconditions.
            Could result in a lot of data edits for small conversation edits
